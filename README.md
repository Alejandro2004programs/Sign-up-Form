Sign up form design as part of the Odin Project. 

I had originally skipped it, but after going further in front-end development,
I realize that design is very important so I came back seeing this project in 
a different light. Not only was it good practice for a sign up form, it was a 
good way to get better at design, and paying attention to alignment, color and 
contrast.
